This project allows you to create your own bubble tea experience by customizing your drink to your preferences! Inspired by my love for boba, this interactive tool lets you explore your creativity, taste preferences, and the fun of customizing your own drink. It's all about building the perfect bubble tea, from selecting your favorite tea base, toppings, and milk, to visualizing your ideal boba drink in a playful, engaging way.

### Features:
